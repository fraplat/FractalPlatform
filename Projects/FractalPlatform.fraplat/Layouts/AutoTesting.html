            <h3>Why Testing Matters</h3>
            <p>When you start using Fractal, you quickly notice how easy it is to build apps, how clean the aspect-functional code looks, and how configurable the components are.</p>
            <p>But that simplicity is backed by complex, low-level algorithms — and they require strong testing tools.</p>
            <p>As a development platform, Fractal puts special emphasis on testing. It’s essential to maintain backward compatibility with all previously deployed apps.</p>
            <p>It’s extremely frustrating when a stable, well-tested app suddenly breaks after a platform update.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>Auto & Load Testing Built In</h3>
            <p>Fractal includes built-in support for unit tests, integration tests, and most importantly — auto and load tests.</p>
            <p>With just a few clicks, developers can record real user scenarios as reusable macro scripts.</p>
            <p>Each scenario is made of steps. At each step, Fractal captures the user's <strong>action</strong> and the resulting <strong>UI response</strong>.</p>
            <p>This approach validates the real-life behavior of your app and helps catch bugs early when core workflows break.</p>
            <p>Fractal also handles tricky cases like time-based data and random GUIDs using a smart "time-back machine" strategy.</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Fractal also supports load testing. It simulates real-world, high-concurrency environments so you can ensure your app performs under pressure.</p>
            <p>This helps developers build robust applications that remain stable even under peak load conditions.</p>

            <p>Here you can view execution times and customize settings — for example, how strictly each step's result is compared to the reference output.</p>
            <p>The example above uses the second-strictest level, meaning all attributes and values on the page must match exactly.</p>

            <h3>Our Commitment to Stability</h3>
            <p>At Fractal, our goal is twofold:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Make it easy to write powerful auto & load tests for your app.</li>
                <li>Guarantee your app continues to work perfectly after every platform update.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently, Fractal's platform stability is verified by <strong>37 usage scenarios</strong>. Even our freelance marketplace is covered by <strong>10 scenarios</strong>.</p>
