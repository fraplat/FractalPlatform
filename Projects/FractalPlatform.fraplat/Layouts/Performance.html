                <h1>Speed Is the Real Benchmark</h1>
                <p>Syntax, framework, even development time — none of that matters as much as raw performance.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Let's Be Honest — Does the Stack Matter?</h3>
            <p>You could build the same app in your regular stack in 2 weeks instead of 2 days with Fractal — the world won’t change because of it.</p>
            <p>Is Fractal code easier to read? That’s subjective. A developer who spent 10 years in Perl might find their syntax more comfortable.</p>
            <p>More flexible for changes? Maybe, but if you already know all your app’s requirements — and don’t expect a major pivot — that might not matter either.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>But There’s One Thing That Always Matters</h3>
            <p>Performance. Speed. The thing that users feel immediately.</p>
            <p>Even a small delay in the UI separates a $30 phone from a $1200 one. Speed is brand. Once users get used to a fast, responsive interface, even a single unnecessary progress bar becomes annoying.</p>
            <p>Today, I’m proud to say: none of the 23 apps we’ve built on Fractal have a single progress bar.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>It's Just the Beginning</h3>
            <p>Most apps so far are internal or test projects — they have features, but not massive loads. Optimization is still ahead. Fractal is like a racecar that just hit the track — fast, but with room for engineering improvements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>Fractal Portal: A Mature Example</h3>
            <p>One of our most advanced apps is the <strong>Fractal Portal</strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Jira-like project management</li>
                <li>Slack-style messaging</li>
                <li>Built-in blog system</li>
                <li>Deployment & monitoring tools for Fractal Cloud</li>
                <li>Student portal for training & exams</li>
                <li>12 permission domains</li>
                <li>Fully translated into 7 languages</li>
                <li>Domain model exceeds 300+ relational tables</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>How Fast Does It Work?</h3>
            <p>Right now, average page load time is about <strong>100ms</strong>. On a warm cache, it's just <strong>12–15ms</strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="section-image">
                <img src="@BaseFilesUrl/Performance.png" alt="Performance Screenshot" />
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Sounds great, but let’s be honest — these results are not from an optimized setup. The server is a 10-year-old laptop with a mobile CPU that wants to go to sleep every second.</p>
            <p>Traffic goes through two routers, two Wi-Fi networks — no fiber involved. Average ping is around 8–10ms. Page generation time? ~1ms. The rest is networking overhead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>More Testing Will Reveal Bugs</h3>
            <p>I'm sure once we hit real-world production, we'll uncover performance issues. That’s normal.</p>
            <p>But Fractal has already crossed the line — it’s no longer a broken-down cart. Even with imperfections, it’s a smoking racecar — already better than any horse in the stable.</p>
