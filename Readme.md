## 🚀 Why Developers Choose Fractal

Traditional development is slow. Typical low-code is rigid. **Fractal Platform is the "3D printer" of software development.**

### **10-100x Faster Development**
Build complex systems in days, not months. Our RealWorld (Conduit) benchmark proves we outpace traditional frameworks by a massive margin.

### **No Drag-n-Drop Limitations**
Forget tedious UI positioning. Fractal automatically generates your UI and CRUD operations directly from your JSON data model.

### **Full Logic Control with C#**
Use the power of .NET to implement business logic. 
No "black boxes" — you have full access to extend functionality and debug with standard tools like Visual Studio.
Use Fractal Studio in web for full development capabilities, including code editing, debugging, and deployment.

### **Aspect-Oriented Architecture (Dimensions)**
Manage security, validation, and calculations through declarative metadata (Dimensions) without cluttering your core logic.

### **No Vendor Lock-in**
Deploy your applications anywhere using Docker containers — AWS, Azure, or your own dedicated servers.
